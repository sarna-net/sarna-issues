**Link to the Extension page**
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:XYZ

**Describe why this extension could be useful**
Please explain the use-cases, or what value this extension brings to Sarna:

* Example: "I would use this extension to do XYZ..."
* Example: "This extension would make XYZ easier..."

**Additional requirements**
Do you know if this extension requires any other MediaWiki extensions, specific PHP versions or extensions, or other services?
* Example: "Requires `Extension:XYZ`"
* Example: "Requires PHP 8.4"
* Example: "Requires A new search engine to be installed"
* Example: "n/a"

**Post-installation configuration**
Will you (or someone else) need to do any post-installation configuration, i.e. create new wiki pages, for this to work?
* Example: "I'll need to import XYZ from Wikipedia"
* Example: "n/a"

_Please note: Extensions can be useful for the wiki, but every new extension incurs an immediate and ongoing "cost": it will take some effort to install and configure, it may bring a performance impact, it may have (in)compatibilities with other current or future extensions, and it will generally increases the cost (in time, testing) of upgrading MediaWiki to the next version.  We don't want to include every extension available as it would cost too much time and resources, so we have to balance the value of the extension vs. the cost in deciding whether to include it or not._
